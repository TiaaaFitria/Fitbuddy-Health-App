# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following section activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
linter:
  rules:
    always_declare_return_types: true
    avoid_print: true
    prefer_const_constructors: true
    prefer_final_fields: true
    unnecessary_getters_setters: false
    # Add more supported lint rules as needed



analyzer:
  errors:
    deprecated_member_use: ignore
    equal_keys_in_map: ignore
    unused_import: ignore
    unused_local_variable: ignore
